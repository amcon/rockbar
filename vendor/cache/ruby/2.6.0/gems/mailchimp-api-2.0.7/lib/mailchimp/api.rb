Note that a merge field can only hold up to 255 bytes. Also, there are a few "special" keys:
        #     - [String] new-email set this to change the email address. This is only respected on calls using update_existing or when passed to lists/update.
        #     - [Array] groupings of Interest Grouping structs. Each should contain:
        #         - [Int] id Grouping "id" from lists/interest-groupings (either this or name must be present) - this id takes precedence and can't change (unlike the name)
        #         - [String] name Grouping "name" from lists/interest-groupings (either this or id must be present)
        #         - [Array] groups an array of valid group names for this grouping.
        #     - [String] optin_ip Set the Opt-in IP field. <em>Abusing this may cause your account to be suspended.</em> We do validate this and it must not be a private IP address.
        #     - [String] optin_time Set the Opt-in Time field. <em>Abusing this may cause your account to be suspended.</em> We do validate this and it must be a valid date. Use  - 24 hour format in <strong>GMT</strong>, eg "2013-12-30 20:30:00" to be safe. Generally, though, anything strtotime() understands we'll understand - <a href="http://us2.php.net/strtotime" target="_blank">http://us2.php.net/strtotime</a>
        #     - [Hash] mc_location Set the member's geographic location either by optin_ip or geo data.
        #         - [String] latitude use the specified latitude (longitude must exist for this to work)
        #         - [String] longitude use the specified longitude (latitude must exist for this to work)
        #         - [String] anything if this (or any other key exists here) we'll try to use the optin ip. NOTE - this will slow down each subscribe call a bit, especially for lat/lng pairs in sparsely populated areas. Currently our automated background processes can and will overwrite this based on opens and clicks.
        #     - [String] mc_language Set the member's language preference. Supported codes are fully case-sensitive and can be found <a href="http://kb.mailchimp.com/article/can-i-see-what-languages-my-subscribers-use#code" target="_new">here</a>.
        #     - [Array] mc_notes of structs for managing notes - it may contain:
        #         - [String] note the note to set. this is required unless you're deleting a note
        #         - [Int] id the note id to operate on. not including this (or using an invalid id) causes a new note to be added
        #         - [String] action if the "id" key exists and is valid, an "update" key may be set to "append" (default), "prepend", "replace", or "delete" to handle how we should update existing notes. "delete", obviously, will only work with a valid "id" - passing that along with "note" and an invalid "id" is wrong and will be ignored.
        # @param [String] email_type optional email type preference for the email (html or text - defaults to html)
        # @param [Bool] double_optin optional flag to control whether a double opt-in confirmation message is sent, defaults to true. <em>Abusing this may cause your account to be suspended.</em>
        # @param [Bool] update_existing optional flag to control whether existing subscribers should be updated instead of throwing an error, defaults to false
